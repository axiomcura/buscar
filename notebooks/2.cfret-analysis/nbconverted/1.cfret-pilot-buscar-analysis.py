# # CFReT Buscar analysis
#
# This notebook demonstrates applying the BUSCAR pipeline to the CFReT pilot Cell Painting dataset.
# It walks through data loading, signature extraction, clustering, measuring phenotypic activity
# (between a reference control and experimental treatments) and ranking treatments by effect.

# ## BUSCAR pipeline

# ### Creating on and off morphology signatures
#
# Here we generate the **on** and **off** morphological signatures to distinguish how phenotypes respond to treatments.
#
# On-Target Signatures (`on_sigs`):
#
# These represent the features that show a **significant statistical shift** from both the control group and the phenotype of interest. We use these to identify the specific morphological changes driven by the experimental conditions.
#
# Off-Target Features (`off_sigs`):
#
# These are the features that remain **unaffected** when comparing the control against the phenotype. This provides a critical baseline, helping us understand which biological markers should stay stable even when a compound is applied.

# ### Measuring phenotypic activity
#
# This section quantifies how each treatment affects cell morphology compared to the reference control (DMSO_heart_11), using the previously defined on and off signatures. The resulting phenotypic scores are used to rank treatments and highlight the most active compounds.
#
# **How scores are calculated:**
#
# - **On-signature features:** We use the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure how much the on-features for each treatment differ from the reference. A higher EMD means a greater morphological change.
# - **Off-signature features:** We use the affected ratio, which detects if features that should remain stable (off-features) are altered by a treatment. A higher affected ratio suggests more off-target or unintended effects.
#
# In summary, low on-signature scores indicate strong, intended phenotypic changes, while high off-signature scores may indicate unwanted or broad effects.
