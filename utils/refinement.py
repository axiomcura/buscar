"""
Profile refinement utilities for filtering out poor quality clusters.

This module provides functions to refine cell profile data by removing treatment-cluster
combinations that have insufficient data quality or representation. The primary method
implemented filters based on cell count thresholds using percentile cutoffs to exclude
clusters with too few cells for reliable analysis.

    ----------
