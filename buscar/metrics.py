This module provides metrics for quantifying phenotypic activity, particularly by comparing
two morphological signatures ("on" and "off"). These signatures represent distinct sets of
features within morphological profiles, enabling the measurement of differences between
reference and experimental conditions.

    This function normalizes scores by dividing all values by the target state's score,
    making the target state equal to 1.0 and all other scores relative to it.

    This enables interpretation as:
    - score < 1.0: closer to reference than target

    2. Off-score: measures unintended effects on features expected to remain unchanged

        experimental conditions.

        will be excluded from distance calculations.
    on_signature : list[str]
        Feature names expected to change between reference and target states. These
        define the desired phenotypic response.
    off_signature : list[str]
        Feature names expected to remain unchanged. These serve as controls to detect
        off-target or non-specific effects.
    ref_state : str
        Value in treatment_col representing the baseline/control condition.
    target_state : str
        Value in treatment_col representing the desired phenotypic state.
    treatment_col : str, optional
        Column name containing treatment identifiers, by default "Metadata_treatment"
    on_method : Literal["emd"], optional
        Method for computing on-scores. Currently only Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)
        is supported, by default "emd"
    off_method : Literal["affected_ratio", "emd"], optional
        Method for computing off-scores:
        - "affected_ratio": proportion of off features that became significant
        - "emd": Earth Mover's Distance in off-feature space
        by default "affected_ratio"
    ratio_stats_method : str, optional
        Statistical test used when ``off_method`` is set to ``"affected_ratio"`` to

    seed : int, optional

        - treatment: treatment condition identifier
        - on_score: normalized distance in on-feature space (lower is better)
